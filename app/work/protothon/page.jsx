                    <p className="pb-3">This past year has kept the Seattle Fire Department extremely busy with a rising call load. We have seen an increase in calls across many areas, including vacant building fires, scenes of violence, automatic fire alarms, suspected overdoses and responses to those who are unhoused.</p>
                    <p>No other specific design feedback was given, the rest was focused on bugs found during the testing as well as the order in which the case information was presented.</p>

                    <p className="pb-3">Before starting on our digital design, we all took time to visualize the different interfaces that we had in mind. These were my initial sketches for the map view, incident view, dashboard, and incident tracking interfaces.</p>
                    <p>After everyone was done sketching, we met back up to discuss our ideas. It was interesting to see how everyone had different visuals for the interfaces. After a thorough discussion, we settled on the designs that we liked and split up the work.</p>

                            <p className="pb-3">Since we were splitting up the design, we wanted to ensure that it was cohesive between interfaces. We were able to quickly decide on a color palette and font style.</p>
                            <p>We wanted to stick with a calmer color palette yet still have some warning colors such as yellow and red for open incidents. We also wanted to separate incidents based on battalion which required a bigger color palette.</p>

                            <p>We chose to also add filters to the top of the page so that users could choose what incidents they wanted to see. The colors to the left of each incident correspond to which battalion they occured in.</p>
